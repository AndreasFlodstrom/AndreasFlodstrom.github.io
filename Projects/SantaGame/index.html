      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Save Christmas</em> is a 3D co-op multiplayer game inspired by <strong>Overcooked</strong>. 
        Players work together—or against each other—to assemble as many toys as possible before time runs out.
        Use abilities to disrupt your opponents and become Santa’s most efficient helper.
      </p>

      <h3>Deep Dive</h3>
      <p>
        This project was created as a personal challenge to push my game development skills. I designed all aspects of the game—from gameplay logic to 3D modeling in Blender. 
        Networking is powered by the <strong>Mirror</strong> framework to simplify multiplayer development and allow focus on gameplay systems. 
        The game also integrates with <strong>SteamSDK</strong> for online play and achievements.
      </p>
