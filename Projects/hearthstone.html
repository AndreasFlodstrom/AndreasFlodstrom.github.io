      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        This project was made with cooperation with 33 other people to make a copy of the game Hearthstone by blizzard entertainment.
        <h3><p>My part of the project</p></h3>   
        <p>I was in charge of the database group which consisted of 9 developers, our objective was to be able to create decks and the collection part of the game and be able to save them locally on the computer.
            Ultimately i had to do almost all work by myself, the database uses json serializers to read and write information locally, each card in the game is made using Unity scriptable objects.
