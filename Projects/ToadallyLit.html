      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Toadally Lit</em> (originally titled <strong>Colosseum</strong>) was my first Unity project — a 2D platformer combat game focused on responsive controls and engaging boss battles. 
        The game challenges players through multiple combat stages, combining timing and movement precision to win each encounter.
      </p>

      <h3>Development Details</h3>
      <p>
        As my introduction to Unity, this project helped me learn the fundamentals of physics interactions, sprite animation, and enemy AI design. 
        I also used Blender to model basic 3D elements and export them into the 2D environment, creating a layered and dynamic look.
      </p>
